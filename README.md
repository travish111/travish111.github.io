This is a private repository for Travis Hurst to store all code from the course. The organization of this repository is as follows.

### Project1

## General requirements 

**Website**: 

I created the website mainly based on the Lab2 project. I removed the unnecessary html code and updated the css later on.

**HTML**:

I attached the html for my overall course catalog in github. This way I can show all of the technical labs, hackathons, and projects once complete.

## Non-technical requirements

**CSS Template/Framework**:

I added the Bootstrap framework as requested in the documentation, as well as the styles.css file for some specific elements.

**Tracker**:

I added a script for the tracker div as recommended in the project description.

## Technical requirements 

**Javascript framework**:

I added javascript code in the script sections of the html. I also added the emailuc.js file to do the show and open email functionality. I continued to use jQuery for the APIs and injected it near the top of the html file.

**APIs**:

I added the original API for the joke from lab2, then in the same script section I added a new API to display a safe meme just underneath. I did need to update the joke API to refresh every minute, so I added the refresh on a 60 second timer.

**Cookies**:

I added the following script to the html code that targets the document cookies on the dom. Then I am displaying it as a header bar. It will either greet the User if they are first time, or let them know the last time they visited the page.
